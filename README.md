# Heart_Rate_Prediction
Heart Rate Prediction Project: This project utilizes machine learning models to predict heart rate based on various input parameters such as age, activity level, and physiological metrics. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation for accurate predictions. Technologies used include Python, Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn.

This project focuses on analyzing cardiovascular and medical data to predict heart health outcomes and generate meaningful insights. The dataset contains key variables such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and exercise-related metrics. Key tasks and objectives include:

Descriptive Analysis:

Compute summary statistics for numerical data (e.g., age, blood pressure, cholesterol, maximum heart rate, and ST depression).
Generate frequency tables for categorical data (e.g., sex, chest pain type, fasting blood sugar, exercise-induced angina, and target output).
Data Visualization:

Create visualizations like histograms, box plots, and bar charts to identify patterns, distributions, and outliers in the dataset.
Correlation Analysis:

Explore correlations between features and the target variable (heart disease presence/absence) to identify significant predictors.
Predictive Modeling:

Develop machine learning models such as logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines to predict heart disease.
Feature Selection:

Identify the most influential features to optimize model performance and reduce complexity.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to measure performance.
Risk Assessment:

Identify risk factors and individuals at higher risk of heart disease based on data insights.
Patient Profiling:

Segment patients based on health characteristics to tailor medical recommendations.
Treatment Recommendations:

Support clinical decisions by identifying suitable treatments, lifestyle changes, or further diagnostics for at-risk individuals.
Public Health Insights:

Analyze trends in heart disease prevalence and risk factors to guide public health policies and interventions.
This project leverages data analysis and machine learning techniques to advance heart health predictions and improve healthcare decision-making.



Treatment Recommendations
   - Use the data to make informed decisions about medical treatment, lifestyle interventions, or further diagnostic testing for individuals at risk of heart disease.

Public Health Insights
    - Use the data to identify trends and patterns in heart disease prevalence and risk factors, which can inform public health policies and interventions.
